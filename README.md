My first repository

Hi my name is Luca I'm a student from Bergamo (Italy);
I'm 17 years old and I'm keen on coding;
I studied C++ at school, Python and Javascript alone with the help of w3school;
I've made a lot of code in C++ but a few in Javascript and Python;
I want to involve in coding;

Don't forget to give a look to my projects!;
